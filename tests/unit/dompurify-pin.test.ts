/**
 * #security-adjacent guard: DOMPurify must stay on 3.3.x.
 *
 * This is a test rather than a doc line because the reason lives in CLAUDE.md,
 * which is gitignored — a contributor retrying the bump cannot read it. They
 * can read a failing test.
 *
 * DOMPurify 3.4 strips HTML inside <foreignObject>, correctly, since that is an
 * injection vector. Mermaid puts labels there. `htmlLabels: false` fixes the
 * renderers that have that option (flowchart, class) and does nothing for the
 * ones that do not: `journey` has no `htmlLabels` option at all and renders
 * completely empty on 3.4.15.
 *
 * Its text writer comes from a different switch —
 *   conf.textPlacement === "fo" ? byFo : conf.textPlacement === "old" ? byText : byTspan
 * — and Mermaid's default config sets "fo". Moving off "fo" is a real lever but
 * only a partial fix, measured on 3.4.15 + mermaid 11.17.2:
 *
 *   default ("fo")  task labels gone,    section label gone
 *   "tspan"         task labels RENDER,  section label still gone
 *   "old"           task labels RENDER,  section label still gone
 *
 * So the pin holds until the section-label gap is solved. `timeline`,
 * `c4Diagram` and `sequenceDiagram` read the same switch and are the next
 * candidates to check.
 *
 * Nothing urgent is being held back: every critical and high Dependabot alert
 * is in a dev or build dependency. DOMPurify's own open alerts are low/medium
 * and mostly inapplicable here — no IN_PLACE, no SAFE_FOR_TEMPLATES, no hooks,
 * no function-based ADD_TAGS.
 *
 * If you are here because this test failed: re-render all 20 Mermaid types in
 * the built app and check the labels. The suite cannot see them.
