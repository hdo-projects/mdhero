// MDHero's version is written out by hand in four places that do not read each
// other — `tauri.conf.json` does NOT derive from `package.json`. A release bump
// has to touch all four, and nothing in the build fails if one is missed.
//
// The consequence is not cosmetic. The macOS Quick Look extension takes its
// `CFBundleShortVersionString` / `CFBundleVersion` from **package.json**
// (`quicklook/build-appex.sh`), while the host app takes its version from
// **tauri.conf.json**. Bump tauri.conf.json and forget package.json and the
// release ships a 0.2.x app with a 0.2.(x-1) extension sealed inside the app's
// code signature — signed, notarized, and quietly inconsistent.
//
// These assertions are the only thing standing between that and a tagged
// release, so keep them cheap and keep them green.
